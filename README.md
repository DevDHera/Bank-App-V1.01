1>Virtual Assistant

    When we are doing banking we have a tendency to ask help from from other people. This can
sometimes cause unnecessary problems among the bank users. Due to that I am initiating the concept 
of virtual assistant in this app. You can chat all your banking problems with the assistant and the 
right answer directly from the bank.
